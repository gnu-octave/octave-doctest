DOCTEST [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/catch22/doctest-for-matlab.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/catch22/doctest-for-matlab)
=======

The Octave-Forge Doctest package finds specially-formatted blocks of example code within documentation files.
It then executes the code and confirms the output is correct.
This can be useful as part of a testing framework or simply to ensure that documentation stays up-to-date during software development.
