doctest 0.8.1 (2025-09-13)
==========================

  * Development repo moved to https://github.com/gnu-octave/octave-doctest

  * Fixes for Octave 9 and Octave 10.

  * Workaround for delete method of subclasses of "handle".



doctest 0.8.0 (2023-01-03)
==========================

  * Expected error messages can be optionally prefixed with "error: ".

  * Writing "??? " at the beginning of an error is now deprecated.

  * Texinfo users can markup errors with `@error{}`.

  * `doctest myclass` has been refactored with various bugs fixed.

  * Preliminary support for `doctest classdef.method` on Octave.

  * Test classdef methods using dotted `classdef.method` while still
    using `@class/method` on old-style classes.

  * Functions defined directly in the Octave interpreter can now be tested.

  * Test suite fixes for Octave 6 and 7.

  * Source code is encoded with UTF-8, indicated with `.oct-config` files.

  * Don't doctest some classdef methods twice.



doctest 0.7.0 (2019-03-23)
==========================

  * Functions within compiled `.oct` files can now be tested.

  * Tests are run with default number formatting (see `help doctest`).

  * More robust to errors during testing.

  * Makefile improvements and fixes.



doctest 0.6.1 (2018-01-04)
==========================

  * Workaround regex bug on ARM (again!).



doctest 0.6.0 (2017-12-25)
==========================

  * Tests can now call "clear" and "clear all".

  * Fixes for running on Octave development versions (upcoming 4.4.0).

  * Minimum supported Octave version is now 4.2.0.  The package no longer
    has any compiled code and does not include an "evalc" implementation.



doctest 0.5.0 (2016-11-13)
==========================

  * SKIP_IF and other conditional directives can include small single-line
    blocks of code.  For example:

      - "% doctest: +SKIP_IF(foo() && bar(42))"

  * Recursion into subdirectories is now the default; pass "-nonrecursive"
    for the previous default behaviour.

  * In Texinfo mode, skip tests without output by default.  This is an
    experimental change to help test the GNU Octave project; the feature
    might disappear without warning in a future version.

  * Workaround regex bug on ARM architecture.

  * Minimum supported Octave version is now 4.0.0.



doctest 0.4.1 (2016-01-04)
==========================

  * Added conditional variants of SKIP and XFAIL directives to control test
    execution based on runtime conditions:

      - "% doctest: +SKIP_IF(condition)"
      - "% doctest: +SKIP_UNLESS(condition)"
      - "% doctest: +XFAIL_IF(condition)"
      - "% doctest: +XFAIL_UNLESS(condition)"

  * Added constants DOCTEST_OCTAVE and DOCTEST_MATLAB that can be used as
    conditions in SKIP_IF etc.

  * Improved handling of example code in TexInfo documentation.

      - Added support for @print{} macros, which may be used for output that
        is not part of a returned value.

      - Examples without ">>" markers use code indentation together with
        @result{} / @print{} macros to classify input and output lines in a
        natural way.  It is no longer necessary to split code into several
        @example / @group blocks.

      - Allow arbitrary TexInfo macros.  The documentation is interpreted
        by makeinfo before running the code examples.

      - Fixed handling of TexInfo files with Windows line endings.

  * Improved folder/directory traversals:

      - Ignore hidden (dot) directories.

      - Ignore files that are neither m-files nor texinfo.



doctest 0.4.0 (2015-07-02)
==========================

  * Change doctest interface to be closer to Octave's test function.

  * Change wildcard string from '***' to '...'.

  * Doctests can be influenced with directives:

      - mark tests to be skipped by appending "% doctest: +SKIP".

      - mark tests expected to fail with "% doctest: +XFAIL".

      - stricter whitespace matching: "% doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE".

      - disable "..." wildcard matching with "% doctest: -ELLIPSIS".

  * Support "doctest foldername" to run tests on the files/classes within
    the folder/directory "foldername".  With optional recursion.

  * Improve evalc implementation on Octave.

  * Other bug fixes.



doctest 0.3.0 (2015-05-12)
==========================

  * Multiline input now works (e.g., a matrix split across lines).

  * Allow "ans = " to be omitted.

  * Pure texinfo files can be tested: "doctest myfile.texinfo".

  * Other bug fixes.

  * Support and directory structure for being an Octave package.



doctest 0.2.0 (2015-04-06)
==========================

  * Octave support, including examples in Texinfo blocks.

  * Return the number of tests and number failed.
